# another-go-installer

Script to install `Golang` and create a basic [workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). By default the script takes the latest version in the download [page](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Features

✔ Detects automatically the Operative System (`mac`, `linux`)

✔ Detects automatically the architecture of your OS (`64`, `32` bits)

❌ Prompts for a github user (to create projects directory inside the workspace)

❌ Installs a specific version

❌ Validates checksum of the downloaded file

## Usage

```bash
another-go-installer <OPTION>
```

### Options

    -i      Installs GoLang
    -r      Removes ALL things GoLang related (Not the workspace)
